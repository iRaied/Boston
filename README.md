## Project Motivation
This is an Udacity Nanodegree Project. I was interested in using Kaggle AirBnB Data to better understand:
<li> What are the most features correlated to price
<li> How well can we predict weather the review is positive or negative from the review text
<li> Understand how much AirBnB homes are earning in certain time frames and areas
<li> Comparing rates between the two cities
